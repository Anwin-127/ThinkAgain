### Project Description
ThinkAgain is the ultimate app for anyone who feels that their decisions are just too simple and could use a lot more unnecessary complexity. Designed to turn minor, everyday choices into epic internal struggles, ThinkAgain brings the world of overthinking to your fingertips. Whether you‚Äôre debating what shirt to wear or which snack to pick, ThinkAgain takes your decisions and transforms them into full-blown, life-altering predicaments with intricate pros and cons, hypothetical scenarios, and plenty of second-guessing encouragement.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are forced to make quick choices, missing out on the joy of overthinking every little detail. For the chronic overthinker, there‚Äôs no tool to turn tiny decisions into epic dilemmas‚Äîuntil now.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
ThinkAgain makes every tiny decision feel monumental by adding wild ‚Äúwhat-ifs,‚Äù endless pros and cons, and last-minute curveballs. It‚Äôs designed to keep you overthinking forever‚Äîbecause why decide when you can endlessly doubt?

### Implementation

This project is developed using Dart for front-end logic and Node.js for the backend, where LLaMA (3B-8B-8192) is hosted and executed to handle language processing tasks. The Flutter framework drives the UI for a seamless, responsive experience. The application interacts with the model using an API key from Groq to enable secure access. Key libraries, including Google Fonts for typography and HTTP Client for handling network requests, further enhance the experience. The server is deployed on Render for scalable hosting, with development carried out in VS Code and¬†Android¬†Studio.
