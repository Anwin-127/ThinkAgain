### Project Description
ThinkAgain is the ultimate app for anyone who feels that their decisions are just too simple and could use a lot more unnecessary complexity. Designed to turn minor, everyday choices into epic internal struggles, ThinkAgain brings the world of overthinking to your fingertips. Whether you‚Äôre debating what shirt to wear or which snack to pick, ThinkAgain takes your decisions and transforms them into full-blown, life-altering predicaments with intricate pros and cons, hypothetical scenarios, and plenty of second-guessing encouragement.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
ThinkAgain tackles the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of making decisions too quickly by turning even the simplest choices into complex, overblown dilemmas. It‚Äôs perfect for chronic overthinkers who crave endless second-guessing, adding layers of hypothetical disasters to every decision so you‚Äôre never really sure.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
ThinkAgain makes every tiny decision feel monumental by adding wild ‚Äúwhat-ifs,‚Äù endless pros and cons, and last-minute curveballs. It‚Äôs designed to keep you overthinking forever‚Äîbecause why decide when you can endlessly doubt?
